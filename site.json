    "about": [
        "I write low-level Rust and occasionally look up to remember why. Low-level computing resonates with my curiosity to understand how things truly work. I like knowing whatâ€™s underneath, how it moves, and how I can build something real from it. I love creating. It's the one thing that always makes sense to me. I think about film and philosophy more than I talk about them. They shape how I see the world, and I try to let that shape my work too."
